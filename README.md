# pix2billions
Turns any image into a map for the game "They Are Billions"

# What is this?

A reddit user named ash47 created a <a href="https://github.com/ash47/TheyAreBillionsModKit">mod kit</a> for the game "They are Billions". He then showed that he could make maps from image files given a specific format. I extended upon his idea by creating a program that generates a map given any image.

Please note: This project must not be used for illegal purposes, or for getting a highscore on any leaderboards that are present in the game, it is strictly for educational purposes and for people to experiment with.

# How do I use it?

The jar file in this repository (pix2billions.jar in the root directory) takes the paths of images and outputs the map equivalents in the same directory. Naming convention for the output of image.png is map-image.png

Make sure you dont forget to install java and any other dependencies to run jar files first.

# Example

0) make sure you got java installed
1) open a terminal and navigate to your folder where the pix2billions.jar is located
2) enter "java -jar pix2billions myimage.png" (given that the image is in the same directory)
3) enjoy your map-myimage.png file
